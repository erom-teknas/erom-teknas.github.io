# 🚀 Welcome to our AWS Deployment with Terraform! 🌟

This Terraform script orchestrates the creation of a robust AWS infrastructure for our **Demo Application** following a two-tier architecture. (note: We are not working on S3 in this demo, hence please ignore S3 from the below diagram)

## 🌐 Network Configuration

We're setting up the network foundation:

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**:
  - Creates a secure and isolated network environment with the CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`.
  - Named `main`, it serves as the backbone of our infrastructure.
  
- **Internet Gateway**:
  - Establishes connectivity between our VPC and the internet, enabling outbound access and allowing public resources to be accessible from the internet.
  
- **Public and Private Subnets**:
  - Divides our network into distinct segments:
    - **Public Subnets** (`10.0.<az>.0/24`):
      - Placed in different availability zones (`<az>`) to ensure high availability.
      - Public-facing resources like load balancers reside here.
    - **Private Subnets** (`10.0.<az+2>.0/24`):
      - Houses backend services and database instances.
      - Isolated from direct internet access for enhanced security.

- **NAT Gateway**:
  - Provides outbound internet access for instances in private subnets.
  - Allows private instances to initiate outbound connections while preventing inbound traffic from reaching them directly.

- **Route Tables**:
  - Manages the routing of traffic within the VPC and to external networks:
    - **Public Route Table**:
      - Routes internet-bound traffic to the internet gateway.
      - Routes internal traffic within the VPC.
    - **Private Route Table**:
      - Routes outbound traffic to the NAT gateway for internet access.
      - Routes internal traffic within the VPC.

## 🌟 Load Balancing

Ensuring efficient traffic distribution:

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
  - Balances incoming HTTP traffic across instances for high availability and fault tolerance.
  - Named `public-lb`, it distributes traffic to backend instances.

- **Target Groups**:
  - Defines the targets for the ALB to distribute traffic.
  - Named `public-lb-target-group`, it specifies the instances behind the ALB.

- **ALB Listener**:
  - Listens to incoming traffic on port 80 and forwards it to the target group for processing.

## 🛡️ Security Configuration

Keeping our infrastructure secure:

- **Security Groups**:
  - Controls inbound and outbound traffic to and from instances:
    - `allow-http-lb`:
      - Allows HTTP traffic for the ALB.
    - `allow-http-ec2`:
      - Allows HTTP and SSH traffic for EC2 instances.
    - `jump-ec2`:
      - Allows SSH traffic for the jump host.

- **Key Pair**:
  - Creates an SSH key pair named `AWSKey` for accessing EC2 instances securely.

## 🚀 Compute Resources

Scaling our application:

- **Launch Template**:
  - Configures the specifications for EC2 instances, including the instance type and security group.
  - Named `ec2-template`, it defines the template for launching EC2 instances.

- **Autoscaling Group**:
  - Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand to maintain performance and availability.
  - Named `ec2-autoscaling`, it ensures the desired capacity is met and scales up or down as needed.

## 🌟 Additional Components

Enhancing functionality:

- **Elastic IP (EIP)**:
  - Provides a static IP address for EC2 instances, enabling them to retain the same public IP even after restarts.

- **Jump EC2 Instance**:
  - Acts as a gateway for SSH access to private instances, facilitating secure communication within the network.

With this comprehensive setup, our Demo Application is poised for success in the AWS cloud as a two-tier architecture! ✨🌟💫
